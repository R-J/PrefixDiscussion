# PrefixDiscussion

Allows prefixing discussion titles with a configurable set of terms. It will not show prefixes in table view for Vanilla version 2.1. Hopefully it will work in 2.2.

## IMPORTANT!
You must set permissions in order to allow your users to a) add and b) view prefixes! (under yourforum/dashboard/role)

Prefixes get the CSS class "SpPrefixname" so they can be styled.
